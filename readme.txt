MailChimp Forms by MailMunch allows you to painlessly add MailChimp sign up forms to your WordPress site as a popup, embedded widget or sticky top bar.

== Description ==

> MailChimp Forms by MailMunch allows you to painlessly add MailChimp sign up forms to your WordPress site. The form captures the lead and sends it to specific MailChimp lists automatically. You can set it to no op-in, opt-in, or double opt-in. You can add forms to posts, pages or sidebar, and also open it as a popup or top bar. Simply sign up and connect your MailChimp account into the plugin admin settings and it will pull in all your MailChimp lists. From there you can choose the lists you want to make forms for.

What is [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com/)? MailChimp is one of the best email marketing tools. Signup up for a [FREE Trial Account](http://www.mailchimp.com/signup/) and see for yourself!
